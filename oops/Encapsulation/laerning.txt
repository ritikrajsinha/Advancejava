Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts. It is the process of binding data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (i.e., a class) and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.

🔐 Why use Encapsulation?
To hide internal implementation details.

To protect data from unauthorized access/modification.

To make the code more maintainable, flexible, and secure.

📦 Real-life Example: ATM Machine
When you withdraw money from an ATM, you interact with a simple interface (screen/buttons).

But you don’t see or control how the transaction happens internally (database checks, authentication, balance update, etc.).

That internal logic is encapsulated.
