Abstraction means hiding internal implementation details and exposing only the required functionality to the user.

It lets the user focus on what an object does, not how it does it.

ðŸš— Real-Life Car Example (Abstraction)
You are driving a car:
You use start(), drive(), stop() â€” that's all.

You don't know or donâ€™t need to know:

How the engine works

How fuel is injected

How sensors communicate

These internal details are abstracted away.
